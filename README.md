### Introduction: Git & GitHub

### Basic Git Workflow
- Project: [Manhattan Zoo](manhattan_zoo.md)


- Project: [SnapFit Robots, Inc.](snapfit_robots_inc.md)
solidifies core Git workflow skills: initializing a repo, tracking and staging files, making commits with clear messages, reviewing commit history, and iterating through edits. A practical exercise in basic version control essentials.
Get hands-on with the foundational Git workflow: initialise a repo, add and stage multiple files, commit with meaningful messages, and review your commit history like a pro. You also practise updating files, staging incremental changes, and committing again — reinforcing the iterative nature of version control. A solid refresher that turns you into a confident Git navigator for any project.

### Important Git Operations
- Project: [Poem Fiasco](poem_fiasco.md)

- Project: [Ascii Portfolio](ascii_portfolio.md)

### Git Branching
Project: [Birthday Party](birthday_party.md) 
- Working with a birthday invitation website, lists are added and headings enlarged. These changes are managed on several branches 


Updating the site with lists and enlarging headings. 
- Use Git to create and merge feature branches for a one-page birthday website. Update the page by swapping paragraphs for lists and enlarging headings. Clean up unused branches and merge approved changes back into master. A straightforward exercise in branching, committing, and merging.
- shorter version: 

Project: [Ruby Time Calculator](ruby_time_calculator.md)
- Practice resolving Git merge conflicts in two markdown files (README.md and examples.md). Merge the edits branch into master, manually pick changes from edits, remove conflict markers, stage, commit, and finally delete the edits branch. A practical drill in conflict resolution and clean commit history management. 
- Resolve Git merge conflicts, manually edit conflicting files, stage and commit resolved changes, and manage branches.
