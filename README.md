# Learn Git & GitHub
This repository contains my solutions to the projects from the course [Learn Git and GitHub](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) on codecademy.

### Introduction: Git & GitHub

### Basic Git Workflow
#### [Manhattan Zoo](manhattan_zoo.md)
> A project that demonstrates basic version control by tracking incremental updates to animal meal guidelines at the Manhattan Zoo, using Git to stage changes, create meaningful commits, and inspect project history.

#### [SnapFit Robots, Inc.](snapfit_robots_inc.md)
> A project that uses Git to track and manage changes to assembly instructions for Snap-Fit Robots Inc., demonstrating file staging, incremental commits, and version history across multiple documentation files.

##### [Link to Git Cheatsheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)

### Important Git Operations
#### [Poem Fiasco](poem_fiasco.md)
> A project that practises Git backtracking by discarding unwanted working directory changes, selectively unstaging files, committing targeted fixes, and resetting to a previous commit to undo mistakes across multiple poem files.

#### [Ascii Portfolio](ascii_portfolio.md)
> A project that practises Git backtracking by restoring committed ASCII art, staging and committing incremental edits, updating metadata across multiple files, and selectively unstaging experimental changes before final commits.

### Git Branching
#### [Birthday Party](birthday_party.md) 
> Working with a birthday invitation website, lists are added and headings enlarged. These changes are managed on several branches 


Updating the site with lists and enlarging headings. 
- Use Git to create and merge feature branches for a one-page birthday website. Update the page by swapping paragraphs for lists and enlarging headings. Clean up unused branches and merge approved changes back into master. A straightforward exercise in branching, committing, and merging.
- shorter version: 

#### [Ruby Time Calculator](ruby_time_calculator.md)
- Practice resolving Git merge conflicts in two markdown files (README.md and examples.md). Merge the edits branch into master, manually pick changes from edits, remove conflict markers, stage, commit, and finally delete the edits branch. A practical drill in conflict resolution and clean commit history management. 
- Resolve Git merge conflicts, manually edit conflicting files, stage and commit resolved changes, and manage branches.

### Git Teamwork
#### [JavaScript Homework](javascript_homework.md)
> 

#### [Recipe Book](recipe_book.md)
> 

### Deploying Websites Using Git and GitHub
#### [Excursion](excursion.md)
> The folder excursion contains the solutions



### Best Practised for GitHub Repositories
#### [The Little Black Fish](little_black_fish.md) 
> Rebasing project

### Collaborating with the GitHub Community
#### [Contributing to the Codecademy Docs Repository](contribute_docs.md)
> 

#### [Wedding RSVP](wedding_rsvp.md)
>



## Course Review
Very easy to follow and I ended up with a thorough grasp of the concepts. 

However there is a lot of overlap between articles, lessons and videos which makes the course a bit bloated. 

It also seems like some of the later lessons are ai generated and the push to use certain paid services and products is not welcome.
