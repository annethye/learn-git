- shorter version: 

#### [Ruby Time Calculator](ruby_time_calculator.md)
- Practice resolving Git merge conflicts in two markdown files (README.md and examples.md). Merge the edits branch into master, manually pick changes from edits, remove conflict markers, stage, commit, and finally delete the edits branch. A practical drill in conflict resolution and clean commit history management. 
- Resolve Git merge conflicts, manually edit conflicting files, stage and commit resolved changes, and manage branches.

## Course Review
Very easy to follow and I ended up with a thorough grasp of the concepts. 

However there is a lot of overlap between articles, lessons and videos which makes the course a bit bloated. 

It also seems like some of the later lessons are ai generated and the push to use certain paid services and products is not welcome.
