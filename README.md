# Learn Git & GitHub
This repository contains my solutions to the projects from the course [Learn Git and GitHub](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) on codecademy.

### Introduction: Git & GitHub

### Basic Git Workflow
#### [Manhattan Zoo](manhattan_zoo.md)
> A project that demonstrates basic version control by tracking incremental updates to animal meal guidelines at the Manhattan Zoo, using Git to stage changes, create meaningful commits, and inspect project history.

#### [SnapFit Robots, Inc.](snapfit_robots_inc.md)
> A project that uses Git to track and manage changes to assembly instructions for Snap-Fit Robots Inc., demonstrating file staging, incremental commits, and version history across multiple documentation files.

##### [Link to Git Cheatsheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)

### Important Git Operations
#### [Poem Fiasco](poem_fiasco.md)
> A project that applies Git backtracking by discarding unwanted working directory changes, selectively unstaging files, committing targeted fixes, and resetting to a previous commit to undo mistakes across multiple poem files.

#### [Ascii Portfolio](ascii_portfolio.md)
> A project that uses Git backtracking by restoring committed ASCII art, staging and committing incremental edits, updating metadata across multiple files, and selectively unstaging experimental changes before final commits.

### Git Branching
#### [Birthday Party](birthday_party.md) 
> A project that practises Git branching by experimenting with multiple feature branches, making isolated changes to a one-page birthday invitation website, and merging approved updates back into the main branch using fast-forward merges to maintain a clean project history.

#### [Ruby Time Calculator](ruby_time_calculator.md)
> A project that resolves Git merge conflicts in two markdown files by merging an edits branch into master, manually selecting the intended changes, removing conflict markers, staging and committing the resolution, and deleting the merged branch.

### Git Teamwork
#### [JavaScript Homework](javascript_homework.md)
> A project that illustrates Git collaboration workflows to review a student's JavaScript homework by cloning a remote repository, creating a dedicated feedback branch, adding code comments, committing the review, and pushing the branch back to the remote for inspection.

#### [Recipe Book](recipe_book.md)
> A project that simulates collaborative Git workflows by making coordinated updates to a shared recipe book repository, synchronising changes between a remote and a local clone, creating a feature branch for a new recipe, and pushing that branch back to the remote to reflect parallel development.

### Deploying Websites Using Git and GitHub
#### [Excursion](excursion.md)
> The folder excursion contains the solutions



### Best Practised for GitHub Repositories
#### [The Little Black Fish](little_black_fish.md) 
> Rebasing project

### Collaborating with the GitHub Community
#### [Contributing to the Codecademy Docs Repository](contribute_docs.md)
> 

#### [Wedding RSVP](wedding_rsvp.md)
>



## Course Review
Very easy to follow and I ended up with a thorough grasp of the concepts. 

However there is a lot of overlap between articles, lessons and videos which makes the course a bit bloated. 

It also seems like some of the later lessons are ai generated and the push to use certain paid services and products is not welcome.
